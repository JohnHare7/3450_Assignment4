    "<h3>Data</h3>\n",
    "The data is the included datasets:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><h4>Linear Regression:</h4> \"NYC_Real_Estate.csv\", which is a subset of some real data on the housing market in NYC. You'll use this dataset to create a linear regression model.\n",
    "<li><h4>Logistic Regression:</h4> \"credit_risk_dataset.csv\", which is a set of simulated credit data. You'll use this dataset to create a logistic regression classification model.\n",

    "<h3>Part 1 - Data Preparation: Both Datasets</h3>\n",
    "<h4>See the two previews above</h4>\n",
    "<h4>Note: There's nothing that you explicitly need to produce here, it is getting your data ready for the next step. </h4>\n",
    "The first part of your process should be to clean and prepare the data (each set). It is in its original form, so there's some stuff in there that isn't perfect. Some things to consider are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Are the varaibles in the data relevant? Some may not be. Use both general knowledge and analysis to make a judgement. \n",
    "<li>Are there missing values? If so, what does that mean? Especially with the T/F columns in the data. \n",
    "<li>What data format is the data? Categorical/numerical? \n",
    "<li>Are there outliers? Should they stay?\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no expectation for you to do any extreme amount of research or analysis to use the data, the cleanup required should be reasonably simple, but required. What to keep/remove/change is up to you. There is not one fixed answer. As you make choices, note a justification. This preparation and clean up kind of blends into the EDA for each. \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<h3>Part 2 - Linear Regression - Real Estate Data: Sales Price (35% of grade)</h3>\n",
    "You'll do a linear regression to predict the <b>SALES PRICE</b>. As part of this you'll need to do some EDA (exploratory data analysis) which will involve walking through exploring and visualizing the data to make sense of what is there, what is useful, and what is not. \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<h3>Part 3 - Logistic Regression - Credit Data: Loan Status (35% of grade)</h3>\n",
    "You'll do a logistic regression to predict the <b>LOAN STATUS</b>. As part of this you'll need to do some EDA (exploratory data analysis) which will involve walking through exploring and visualizing the data to make sense of what is there, what is useful, and what is not.\n",

    "<h3>Overall Format (15% of grade)</h3>\n",
    "Please make your workbook readable. Someone should be able to read through from end to end and get a solid understanding of what happened and what the findings were. The goal is to basically say, \"here's a walkthrough of how I did this regression, and here are the results.\"\n",
